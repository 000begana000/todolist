Hello users! thanks for your interest in my todo list app.
I desinged and built this app by myself, based on millenniel & analogic vibe.
you need to be mind that you can't delete task, but edit.
why? I value all the path we are going through, every achievement is precious. and I want to leave every tracks that we've made until finishing project.
